# bazel_rules_vivado: Xilinx Vivado Rules for Bazel

## Overview

`bazel_rules_vivado` provides Bazel rules for building Xilinx Vivado projects. This allows for a portable and ephemeral Vivado installation to be used within your Bazel builds.

This project relies on an approach that executes Vivado tools within a Docker container. This container is built from a Vivado installation archive you provide, as detailed in the prerequisites. The core mechanism is inspired by `bazel-rules-bid` (https://github.com/filmil/bazel-rules-bid), which enables running binaries within a Docker container as a Bazel build action.

It's important to note that distributing the Docker container itself is generally not feasible due to licensing and size, so you will need to build it locally. The setup of the required Vivado Docker image is handled by the `rules_vivado` project (https://github.com/agoessling/rules_vivado), which these rules depend upon. Please refer to their documentation for details on creating and installing the Vivado container.

## Prior Art

*   [agoessling/rules_vivado](https://github.com/agoessling/rules_vivado): This repository predates `bazel_rules_vivado`. It adopts a different approach, requiring a pre-installed Vivado instance rather than using a containerized version.
